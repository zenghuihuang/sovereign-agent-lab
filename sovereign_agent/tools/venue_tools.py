"""
sovereign_agent/tools/venue_tools.py
=====================================
The venue tool layer for your Sovereign Agent.

This file is part of the persistent sovereign_agent/ project.
It will be imported by your research agent in Exercise 2,
and the same tools will be exposed via MCP in Exercise 4.

In Week 2 you will ADD more tools to this file (web_search, file_ops).
The interface you establish here — each tool as a @tool decorated function
returning a JSON string — stays the same throughout the course.

WHY TOOLS RETURN JSON STRINGS
------------------------------
The LangGraph agent feeds tool results back into the model's context as text.
JSON strings are:
  - Human-readable (the model can parse them)
  - Consistent (always the same shape, success or failure)
  - Type-preserving (integers stay integers, booleans stay booleans)

Never return a plain string like "The pub is full." — the model can't
reliably extract structured data from that. Never raise an exception —
that crashes the agent loop. Always return a structured dict as a JSON string.

WEEK 1 TASK
-----------
These functions are provided as working stubs. Your task in Exercise 2
is to use them inside a LangGraph agent, not to modify them here.

The one thing you WILL do here: make sure you understand what each function
returns and when it returns an error — because the agent's ability to reason
about failures depends entirely on what these functions return.
