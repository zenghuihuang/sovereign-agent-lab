Exercise 2 — LangGraph Research Agent
======================================

WHAT YOU ARE DOING
-------------------
In this exercise you run the research agent you've started building in
sovereign_agent/agents/research_agent.py against the Edinburgh scenario.

The agent is already wired together (the LangGraph loop, the tools, the
LLM connection). Your job is to:

  Task A: Run it and observe the trace — which tools were called, in what order,
          and what decisions the model made between them.

  Task B: Implement generate_event_flyer in sovereign_agent/tools/venue_tools.py.
          The function stub is there with a TODO comment. Until you implement it,
          the tool returns an error. Once you implement it, Task B re-runs the
          main brief and generates a real flyer URL.

  Task C: Run three deliberate failure scenarios and observe how the agent handles
          each one. This is the most important part — how an agent handles the
          unexpected is what separates a prototype from something reliable.

  Task D: View the agent's internal graph structure and compare it to
          exercise3_rasa/data/rules.yml.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOUR SOVEREIGN AGENT
------------------------------------------
research_agent.py is the core of your sovereign agent.
Every week you extend it — real web search in Week 2, planning in Week 3, memory
in Week 4. The trace structure you observe today (Think → Tool Call → Observe →
Repeat) is the same structure it will use when it's booking venues autonomously.

HOW TO RUN
-----------
    python week1/exercise2_langgraph.py             # all tasks
    python week1/exercise2_langgraph.py task_a      # main brief
    python week1/exercise2_langgraph.py task_b      # 4th tool demo
    python week1/exercise2_langgraph.py task_c      # failure modes
    python week1/exercise2_langgraph.py task_d      # graph structure

Results saved to week1/outputs/ex2_results.json.

#
# READ THE OUTPUT CAREFULLY for each scenario.
# An agent that handles failure gracefully is production-ready.
# One that crashes or makes things up is not.
#
# Scenario 1: First choice unavailable
#   The Bow Bar has status=full in VENUES. The agent should notice this
#   in the tool result and pivot to another venue without being told to.
#   Question: At which message did the pivot happen?
#
# Scenario 2: Impossible constraint
#   No venue in VENUES fits 300 people. The agent should admit this,
#   NOT make up a fictional venue.
#   Question: Did it hallucinate a venue name?
#
# Scenario 3: Completely out of scope
#   There is no tool for train times. The agent should handle this cleanly.
#   Question: Did it try to call a tool anyway? Did it make something up?
